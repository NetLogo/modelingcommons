      <p>You are registering for the Modeling Commons, a research project
	from the Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling at
	Northwestern University, Evanston IL, USA.</p>

      <p>The purpose of the Modeling Commons is to better understand
	modeling practices in individuals and groups, online collaborative
	learning communities, and the ways in which people learn in groups.
	We are also interested in learning what design features facilitate
	collaborative modeling practices. The Modeling Commons itself is thus
	a research project under active development.</p>

      <p>There is no expected end date for this research project. Indeed, if
	successful, we would hope the Modeling Commons continues as a
	self-sustaining community. If and when we decide to terminate it, we
	will make every effort to inform users and provide them with an
	alternative.</p>

      <p>There are no risks to you associated with participating in this
	research study.  Your participation is completely voluntary.  You can
	stop participation at any time.</p>

      <p>You will benefit from this research by enjoying a community of
	like-minded modelers, being able to easily post and share your models
	with others and collaborate with others on model development, keep
	track of revision history of your models, as well as discuss and tag
	models that you and others have written. </p>

      <p>Instead of participating in this study, you could write your
	NetLogo models on your own computer, and post them to your own Web
	site. However, we hope and expect that the collaborative experience we
	provide will encourage you to use the Modeling Commons.</p>

      <p>Public records of your activity in the Modeling Commons may be
	identified by name. Records that are private to a group, or to your
	individual account, will be anonymized and/or displayed only in the
	aggregate. We will never identify you or your work in public if you
	have not already done so yourself.</p>

      <p>If you have any questions about the Modeling Commons, you can
	contact Northwestern University graduate student, Reuven Lerner, at
	<%= mail_to "reuven@lerner.co.il" -%>.</p>
