<% @title = "Modeling Commons help" %>

<p>Click <%= link_to "here", :action => :intro -%> for a quick
  introduction, or <%= link_to "here", :action => :screencasts -%> for
  a directory of screencsts describing basic features of the Modeling
  Commons.</p>

<p>The Modeling Commons is a public space for online modeling in
  <%= link_to "NetLogo", "http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo" -%>
  (Wilensky, 1999), developed by
  the <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu">Center for Connected
    Learning and Computer-Based Modeling ("CCL")</a> at Northwestern
  University.  The goal is to make it easy for people to share models
  with one another, to collaborate on modeling projects, and to
  discuss models.</p>

<p>Among other things, this is a research project, as well as a work
  in progress.  So you should expect to see things change and (I hope)
  improve over time.  The research itself has to do with the creation of
  an online learning community for modelers -- trying to find the best
  ways to facilitate improved modeling and learning.</p>

<h2>Questions?  Comments?</h2>

<p>If you have any comments or questions about the Modeling Commons,
  please contact <%= mail_to "reuven@lerner.co.il", "Reuven M. Lerner" -%>,
  who has created the Commons as part of his PhD research.  (Reuven's
  advisor is
  <%= link_to "Uri Wilensky", "http://ccl.northwestern.edu/uri/" -%>, director of the
  <%= link_to "CCL", "http://ccl.northwestern.edu" -%>, which produces NetLogo.) </p>
