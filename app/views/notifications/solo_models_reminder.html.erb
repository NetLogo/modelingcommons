<p>Greetings from the <a href="http://modelingcommons.org/">NetLogo Modeling Commons</a>!</p>

<p>This is an automated reminder that your <%= pluralize(@solo_models.count, 'model') %> 
is listed as having a single person work on it (i.e., you).  Now
  that's just fine, and we're delighted that you have contributed to
  the Modeling Commons.  But we want to be sure that everyone who has worked on a model receives
  appropriate credit.</p>

<p>(You should receive this message only once per model that you upload.)</p>

<p>So if anyone has helped you with a model &mdash; as a modeler, domain
  expert, advisor, or in another role &mdash; we encourage you to log into the 
  <a href="http://modelingcommons.org">Modeling Commons</a> and
  identify those collaborators, by clicking on the "Add a
  collaborator" link on a model page.  (This link is only visible to a
  model's authors.)</p>

<p>We recently made it possible to acknowledge collaborators who are
  not members of the Modeling Commons.  To add such a person, enter
  their e-mail address, in addition to their name.  We'll thank them
  for their contributions, and their name will appear on the model
  page, along with other contributors.  (If and when such people join
  the Modeling Commons, we'll be sure that the collaboration credit
  points to their new account.)</p>

<p>Your <%= pluralize(@solo_models.count, 'model') %>:</p>

<ul>
  <% @solo_models.each do |model| %>
  <li><%= link_to model.name, "http://modelingcommons.org/browse/one_model/#{model.id}" %></li>
  <% end %>
</ul>

<p>If you have any questions about the Modeling Commons, please
  <a href="mailto:modelingcommons@ccl.northwestern.edu">contact
    us</a>.  We enjoy getting feedback, and helping to
  improve the Modeling Commons for our users.</p>
