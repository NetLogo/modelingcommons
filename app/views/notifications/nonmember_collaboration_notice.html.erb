    <p>Greetings from the 
      <a href="http://modelingcommons.org">NetLogo Modeling Commons</a>,
      a Web-based collaboration system for 
      <a href="http://ccl.northwestern.edu/">NetLogo</a> modelers.</p>

    <p>This is to let you know that <%= @person.fullname %> 
      (<%= @person.email_address %>) has added you as a collaborator
      '<%= @node.name %>' model.</p>

    <p>You can visit this model at:
      <a href="http://modelingcommons.org/browse/one_model/<%= @node.id %>"> 
	model's page</a></p>.

    <p>Because you are not a member of the Modeling Commons, your name
    and e-mail address will be listed next to the model, but you will
    not be able to edit or otherwise change it.  If and when you
    register as a Modeling Commons user, your collaborations will be
    folded into the registered user, which will give you those
    privileges.</p>

    <p>If you have any questions about the Modeling Commons, please
      <a href="mailto:modelingcommons@ccl.northwestern.edu">contact
	us</a>.  We enjoy getting feedback, and helping to
      improve the Modeling Commons for our users.</p>
