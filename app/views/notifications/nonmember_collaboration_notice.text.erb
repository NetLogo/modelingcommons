Greetings from the NetLogo Modeling Commons, a Web-based collaboration system for NetLogo modelers.

This is to let you know that <%= @person.fullname %> (<%= @person.email_address %>) has added you as a collaborator '<%= @node.name %>' model.

You can visit this model at: http://modelingcommons.org/browse/one_model/<%= @node.id %>

Because you are not a member of the Modeling Commons, your name and e-mail address will be listed next to the model, but you will not be able to edit or otherwise change it.  If and when you register as a Modeling Commons user, your collaborations will be folded into the registered user, which will give you those privileges.

If you have any questions about the Modeling Commons, please contact us at modelingcommons@ccl.northwestern.edu .  We enjoy getting feedback, and helping to improve the Modeling Commons for our users.
