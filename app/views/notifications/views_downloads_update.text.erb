Greetings from the NetLogo Modeling Commons!

We keep track of how often your models are viewed and downloaded, and wanted to share that information with you:

  <% @person.models.each do |model| %>
    - <%= link_to model.name, "http://modelingcommons.org/browse/one_model/#{model.id}" %>: Viewed <%= pluralize(model.views, 'time') %>, downloaded <%= pluralize(model.downloads, 'time') %> (<% model.permission_description %>)
  <% end %>

To remove yourself from such notifications in the future, click on "edit your profile" from any page on the Modeling Commons.

If you have any questions about the Modeling Commons, please contact us.  We enjoy getting feedback, and helping to improve the Modeling Commons for our users.
