# NetLogo bitmap extension

This package contains the NetLogo bitmap extension. It allows you to perform manipulations like scaling, converting to grayscale, and grabbing a single channel on images and import them into the patches or drawing.

## Using

The bitmap extension is pre-installed in NetLogo. For instructions on using it, or for more information about NetLogo extensions, see the NetLogo User Manual.

## Building

Use the NETLOGO environment variable to tell the Makefile which NetLogoLite.jar to compile against.  For example:

    NETLOGO=/Applications/NetLogo\\\ 5.0 make

If compilation succeeds, `bitmap.jar` will be created.
